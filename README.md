# ‚öôÔ∏è Electric Motor Torque Prediction with Deep Learning

This repository implements machine / deep learning models to predict the torque (CEM) of small electric motors based on various physical and electrical parameters.

## üß† Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, splits data into training and validation sets, and scales the features for model compatibility.
- **Multiple Regression Models**:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Neural Network models with varying architectures:
    - Simple linear model
    - Multi-layer feedforward models
    - Batch normalization-based models for improved performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares the models' performances using R¬≤ score, visualizes learning curves (training vs. validation loss), and applies early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Model architectures and training parameters (such as epochs, batch size, and optimizer) are fine-tuned for optimal performance.

## ‚ö° Technologies Used

- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` (data manipulation)
  - `scikit-learn` (machine learning models and preprocessing)
  - `matplotlib` (visualization)
  - `keras` and `tensorflow` (deep learning)
  - `tqdm` (progress bar during training)

- **Machine Learning**: Regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
- **Deep Learning**: Keras-based deep neural networks with various architectures, early stopping, and batch normalization techniques.

## üìä Training Setup

- **Training-Validation Split**: Data is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
- **Feature Scaling**: Features are normalized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.
- **Training Process**: Models are trained over several epochs (max 5000), and early stopping is applied to prevent overfitting. The training progress is displayed using a tqdm progress bar.

## üìà Performance

- **Learning Curves**: Training and validation losses are plotted for each model to visualize the model's performance over epochs.
- **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function. The best-performing models are selected based on the lowest validation loss.

## üìÅ Data

The data used for training comes from the file `data_pn-fm-machines.xlsx`. It contains various features related to the motors and the target variable, CEM (torque). 

**Important Columns**:
- Features: Various electrical and mechanical parameters of the motor.
- Target: `CEM` (torque).

## üîß How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the training script:
